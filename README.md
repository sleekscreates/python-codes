**My Python Code** is a collection of code that I have taken my time to write as I continue to learn Python programming language.

The First Python code is a Python Function that checks whether a number belongs to a Fibonacci Sequence or Not when you input any number on the function.

## What is Fibonacci Sequence?

**Fibonacci sequence** is a sequence or a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceeding ones. 

It usually begins with 0 and 1.

Mathematically, it is represented as **Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2** for n>1 where **Fo = 0** and **F1 =11**.

In this Python code I have used if elif else lop which has four main conditions or expessions.

First, you declare the Python function, using *def Fibonacci(n):*

Secondly, you start with the **If statement** which is your first condition. i.e if **n < 0** the code will print out "Invalid input".

Then **elif statement**, **n == 0** and the code checks if n = 0 then it returns 0 on the interpreter.

Then another **elif statement** **n == 1 or n == 2** and the code checks whether n = 1 or 2 then it returns 1 on the interpreter.

Lastly, **else statement** which will return the *Fibonacci sequence* of numbers greater than 2.
